# Callidus

Fake phone caller app I made (but never used) for getting out of awkward situations. I set up [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) to activate Callidus whenever the phone proximity sensor had been tripped 10 times within 10 seconds, so that I could tap my phone innocuously against myself to trigger the "phone call." It would play the phone's ringtone while vibrating and showing a random 864 area code phone number for upstate South Carolina, where I lived at the time.
